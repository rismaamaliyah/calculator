# Calculator 🔢

A simple on-screen calculator I built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).
It handles basic math operations and some extra functionality while keeping a clean UI.

The main goal of this project was to practise **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **building application logic** without relying `eval()` or external libraries.

## ✨ What It Can Do

- Perform basic operation: add, substract, multiply, divide
- Clear button to reset calculations
- Decimal supports
- Backspace to undo last input
- Handles division by zero with an error message
- Prevents consecutive operators from breaking the calculation
- Starts a new calculation cleanly after showing a result

## 💡 Extra Touches

- Keyboard input support
- Responsive design that works on different screen size
- Rounded answers for long decimals
